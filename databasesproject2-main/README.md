-> Designed and implemented notification system that alerts the user when another user follows,
comments, bookmarks, or likes their content. It is non-trivial as it integrates front-end UI, 
controller logic, and service-layer database operations. To access the feature click on the
notifications tab. After clicking the tab the user will see all the notifications they have
and they can choose to delete specific notifications or delete all of them.

  select from 20 default avatars or upload their own avatar icon. It is non-trivial

  server-side file management into a smooth, interactive experience. To access this
  feature, simply click on the avatar icon located in the top bar field to the right
  of the hashtag search feature. Upon clicking the icon, the user will be redirected
  to the select avatar page.
