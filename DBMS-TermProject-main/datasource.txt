Data Source for HCI Insights Project

The dataset used in this project was synthetically generated using a custom Python script. The script utilizes the Faker library to create realistic user names, 
participant information, tasks, subtasks, and session results. Randomization was applied to attributes such as age, occupation, task completion times, errors, 
and scores to simulate realistic HCI study data.

All data generation logic is contained in the Python script generate_data.inpyb, which outputs SQL INSERT statements for populating the database. 
Foreign key relationships between tables (Users, Study, Participant, Task, Subtask, Session, and Result) were carefully maintained to ensure referential integrity.

No external dataset was used. All data in the database is artificially generated and does not contain any personally identifiable information.

The output is in data.sql
populate.sql is a smaller table used for testing purposes and does not have least one table with more than 1000 rows
